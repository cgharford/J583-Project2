For this project, I used a logo created by Sean Farrell that can be found on
dribble here: https://dribbble.com/shots/1462636-Space. I chose the logo
because I liked the clean, open vibe it exudes and it the whole theme seemed
to fit with my 'Client's' blog. I wanted the design to be thoughtful and
peaceful with a bit of an artsy/typewriter feel, and this logo perfectly
represents that.
